### A brief description of what this project does and who it's for -
 Welcome to the Caesarius Cipher project! This project aims to provide a simple implementation of the famous Caesarius Cipher encryption algorithm. The Caesarius Cipher, also known as the Shift Cipher, is one of the earliest known substitution ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

 This project is designed for cryptography enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in learning about historical ciphers. It allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and perform a brute force attack on messages using the Caesarius Cipher.
## Features

- Encryption: Encrypt any plaintext message by shifting each letter a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
- Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted message by reversing the shift and recovering the original plaintext.
- Brute Force Attack: Perform a brute force attack to automatically try all possible shift values and find the correct decryption for an unknown ciphertext.
- Customizable Shift: Choose the number of positions to shift the letters, allowing for different encryption strengths.
- Support for Alphabets: The cipher supports both uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet, while preserving the case of the original message.


## Usage 

To use CaesariusCipher, simply download the source code and run it on your local machine. The tool is easy to use and can be customized to fit your specific encryption and decryption needs.
